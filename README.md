audio effect pedal station soft/hard ware design

Design Goals: 
* Supports instantaneous switching between 8 different tracks in live by foot pedals ï¼ˆe.g., 6 recoding + 2 from MIDI) 
* Use recycle materials as many as possible (Computer & LCD screen, lumber)
* Use open source software: Linux system and looping software 
* (optionally) portable (Use battery instead of AC power)
